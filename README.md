## ChangeMyMind
# Description: 
People often live in their own bubbles without the opportunity to hear dissenting opinions in a respectful way. Change My Mind is a web application that pairs users in chat rooms, allowing them to choose a topic of discussion and engage in conversation. Users will typically be matched based on "opposing" views on more serious topics such as politics to lighthearted debates like "pancakes v.s. waffles".

The purpose of this application is to provide a fun discussion platform for people to present their opinions honestly. People are encouraged to have friendly conversations that may or may not lead to the other person "changing their mind".
