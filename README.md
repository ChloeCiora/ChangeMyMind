# ChangeMyMind
Description:  People often live in their own bubbles without the opportunity to hear dissenting opinions in a respectful way. Change My Mind is a web application that pairs users in chat rooms, allowing them to choose a topic of discussion and engage in conversation. Users will typically be matched based on "opposing" views on more serious topics such as politics to lighthearted debates like "pancakes v.s. waffles".
